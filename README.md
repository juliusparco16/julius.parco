This repository contains the code for my personal portfolio website, showcasing my skills, experience, and projects as a Senior Microservices Developer.

## Features

* **Responsive Design:** Adapts to various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
* **Content Sections:** Includes About Me, Technical Skills, Professional Journey (Timeline), Key Projects, Education, and Certifications.
* **Interactive Background:** Features a subtle constellation network animation using HTML5 Canvas.
* **Fade-in Animations:** Content sections fade in smoothly as the user scrolls.
* **CV Integration:** Content is based on my professional resume, highlighting key achievements and technologies.

## Technologies Used

* **CSS3:** For styling, layout (including Flexbox/Grid), and animations.
    * CSS Variables for theming.
    * Font Awesome for icons.
    * Google Fonts (Poppins) for typography.

    * DOM manipulation.

    * Intersection Observer API for scroll animations.
    * HTML5 Canvas API for the background animation.

## Structure
